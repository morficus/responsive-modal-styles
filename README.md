Responsive Modal Styles
=======================

A series of sample CSS to style modals that behave nicely on a variety of screen sizes


Motivations
---
I find most of the modals provided by the CSS frameworks I normally use (most of the time, Bootstrap). Are just not great...and they really suck on mobile devices:  

* some don't adjust to the users screen size
* others can't properly handle lengthy content on a smaller or lower resolution screen
* action buttons aren't always visible
* and the list goes on

So I took it upon my self to fix this issue in as many CSS frameworks as I could.  
This solution promises the following:

* the modal will occupy the optimal amount of screen real estate, regardless of screen size.
* modal controls (close button and footers) will always be accessible, regardless of content length.
* title (or header) will also always be visible (in most cases), regardless of content length.


How To Use
---
Go into the folder named after the CSS framework you are using and grab the "responsive-modal.css" file.  
You can either use the file directly in your project, or copy/paste its content into one of your existing style sheets.  
And then, of course, modify the commented properties (to adjust height and width) to fit your needs.

Make sure to take a look at the existing stylesheets and try to match the code formatting as much as possible (just for consistency).
